# Contributing To Emerging-Optimizers

## Dependency

Use [abseil-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py/tree/main)'s **logging**, **testing** and **flags** instead of Python's own **logging**, **unittest** and **argparse**.

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing dependencies. For reproducible builds, our project tracks the generated `uv.lock` file in the repository.
On a weekly basis, the CI attempts an update of the lock file to test against upstream dependencies.

New required dependencies can be added by `uv add $DEPENDENCY`.

New optional dependencies can be added by `uv add --optional --extra $EXTRA $DEPENDENCY`.

`EXTRA` refers to the subgroup of extra-dependencies to which you're adding the new dependency.
Example: For adding a TRT-LLM specific dependency, run `uv add --optional --extra trtllm $DEPENDENCY`.

New dependencies to a dependency group can be added with `uv add --group $GROUP $DEPENDENCY`. Dependency groups are specific to uv and are also optional dependencies but not intended to be used with the package such as docs dependencies.

Alternatively, the `pyproject.toml` file can also be modified directly.

Adding a new dependency will update UV's lock-file. Please check this into your branch:

```bash
git add uv.lock pyproject.toml
git commit -m "build: Adding dependencies"
git push
```

### 🧹 Linting and Formatting

We use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. CI does not auto-fix linting and formatting issues, but most issues can be fixed by running the following command:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
uv run ruff format .
```

## Coding Style

We generally follow [Google's style guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/) , with some exceptions:

* Line length extended to 120 for Python and 100 for C++ code.
* Common use in PyTorch, which are prohibited by Google style, are allowed, including but not limited to:
  * Import function, class, not just module
  * Some special variable name, `x`, `dX`, etc.
* Allow common capitalized naming in Triton code.

Although common, **mixed case is not allowed** in any code. "Mixed case" here means camelCase (e.g. `getFoo`, `myVariable`); PascalCase for classes and snake_case for functions/variables follow Google style as usual.

Run pre-commit at local before submitting merge request. You can also read [.pre-commit-config.yaml]( .pre-commit-config.yaml) to understand what are being forced. The **mypy** settings are inherited from PyTorch.

## Test

All tests should be placed under [tests](tests). We aim for 100% test coverage for this tiny project.

We use [abseil-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py/tree/main) **testing** because it is easier to launch multi process than alternatives.

Every test file must define `--device` and `--seed` flags — CI invokes every test under both `--device=cpu` and `--device=cuda`, and runs each GPU test twice (random seed, then a fixed seed). A test without these flags will fail at flag parsing in CI. Match the pattern used in existing test files: `flags.DEFINE_enum("device", "cpu", ["cpu", "cuda"], ...)`, `flags.DEFINE_integer("seed", None, ...)`, and a `setUpModule` that seeds when `FLAGS.seed is not None`.

When using `torch.testing.assert_close`, do not override the `msg` argument with a bare string — that replaces the default diff/atol/rtol summary, which is what makes CI failures debuggable. Pass `msg=` as a callable that takes the default message and returns one with your context appended. Canonical pattern (from the [PyTorch 2.11 docs](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/2.11/testing.html#module-torch.testing)):

```python
torch.testing.assert_close(
    actual, expected, msg=lambda msg: f"Header\n\n{msg}\n\nFooter"
)
```

`atol` and `rtol` must be set together or not at all — passing only one raises `ValueError`. Use both or neither (the default tolerances are dtype-aware).

## Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
